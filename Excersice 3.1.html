<p style="text-align:center;margin-righ:40px;margin-left:40px"> The system unit is one of the four main hardware components of a computer. It is usually a rectangular container within which other
important internal hardware components can be found. Some of the components in the system unit are; Random Access Memory
(RAM),Compact Disc-Read Only Memory (CD-ROM), Hard disk, Motherboard, Fan, Processor or Central Processing Unit (CPU),
Power Supply and Floppy Disk Drive.
<br>
<br>
The system unit also has other components like the Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports, power button, cables, video and sound cards.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Random Access Memory (RAM)</dt>
  <dd>- the main memory of the computer system whose main function is to store data temporary.</dd>
  <dt>Compact Disc-Read Only Memory (CD-ROM)</dt>
  <dd>- storage devices onto which certain amount of audio files, data and other computer files can be stored.</dd>
  <dt>Hard disk</dt>
  <dd>- stores information, files and other documents permanently as its main function and also allows the retrieval of data but it is non-volatile(data is not loss when the computer goes off).</dd>
  <dt>Motherboard</dt>
  <dd>- the main internal hardware component of the system unit.</dd>
  <dt>Processor or Central Processing Unit (CPU)</dt>
  <dd>- a hardware component responsible for all operations that is carried out in the computerâ€™s system which is why most computer users refer to it as the brain of the computer and it is held on the motherboard by a slot.</dd>
  <dt>Universal Serial Bus (USB)</dt>
  <dd>- allow the computer user to connect USB items to the system unit to be explored.</dd>
  <dt>Power button</dt>
  <dd>- used to turn on the system unit</dd>
  <dt>Video and Sound cards</dt>
  <dd>- video or graphics card and sound card enable the computer to play videos and sounds respectively.</dd>
  <dt>Fan</dt>
  <dd>- keep the system unit cooled.</dd>
  <dt>Cables</dt>
  <dd>- used to connect the components to each other. </dd>
