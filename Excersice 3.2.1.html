		The basic ingredients for any leche flan recipe is made up of only three major ingredients: egg yolks, condensed milk, and evaporated milk. 
		The zest from a dayap or a green lemon and vanilla extract add depth to the flavor of the flan itself.

		What may make the leche flan even more irresistible is the liquid caramel sauce it sits in. Making this can be tricky for anyone new to making leche flan. 
		A trick when making the caramelized sugar is to make sure to heat sugar over low heat and take it out before bubbles form. 
		The beauty of leche flan recipes is that you can also adjust the sweetness, add more eggs, or even milk as you please! 
		It takes practice to make the perfect leche flan, but not really as difficult as it seems.
